    <p>Entropy is a spontaneous process. Knowledge is lost to chaos. A lifetime is a process of gathering experiences, knowledge, wisdom, information, only for it to be lost alongside one's mind upon death, even earlier and painful if riddled with sickness of the mind. Persistence of knowledge is achieved through documentation, for what is a human with forgotten memories, for what is humanity with forgotten knowledge.</p>
    <div class="horizontal-flex cross-centered">
        <span class="material-symbols-outlined heading opacity-low font-wt500">markdown</span>
        <h1>Markdown</h1>
    </div>
    <p>Every document in ryth is written in a slight variation of Markdown. Markdown allows you to format your notes with headings, lists, hyperlinks, code-blocks, and everything else, while still keeping your document source readable and allowing you to export it anywhere.</p>
    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Anything followed by a single pound (#) is formatted as a Primary Heading.</p>
    <p><span class="bordered-bg-white padin-half-em"># This is the Title</span> is rendered as:</p>
    <div class="dashed-border pad-1em"><h1>This is the Title</h1></div>
    <p>Similarly, anything followed by double pounds (##) is formatted as a secondary heading, and three pounds (###) is a tertiary heading.</p>
    <h3 class="underline">pound with a bang!</h3>
    <p>A pound followed by a bang (#!) is for really big, I mean really insanely ungodly massively huge headings. (try it yourself!)</p>
    <h2>Tags</h2>
    <p>The '@' symbol followed by a word creates a tag. Any tags you create show up in the tags section of notes. Tags are used to search, filter and organize your notes.</p>
    <p>For example, <span class="bordered-bg-white padin-half-em">@important</span> is rendered as:</p>
    <div class="dashed-border pad-1em"><span class="chip inverted-color display-inline-block">important</span></div>
    <p>If you select some tags, only the notes that contain all of your selected tags show up.</p>
